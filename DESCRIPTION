Description: RHermes is a broad-scoped targeted metabolomics package to identify
  compounds from biological and environmental samples using a context-specific
  database of formulas and adducts. RHermes offers a comprehensive and 
  sample-specific MS1 and MS2 compound identification strategy. Additionally,
  the package offers an easy-to-use GUI to help with the processing and to
  visualize the results.
